# js-location

### keeps api params in sink with urls

You can use it with universal-router to replace
packages like react-router. See the
[example](https://github.com/NCarson/js-location/blob/master/example/App.js).

And then instead lame window.location like locations injected into your props you can get your 
super-sweet api aware locations, and then remove a lot of crufty code out the view.

### Install

npm i js-location
